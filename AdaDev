    1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

	I majored in Computer Science graduating from CWU in Ellensburg in 2014
	I have been to a number of industry events, and I am currently the active member of many groups
	I have volunteered at several organizations, including FIRST, WSOS, The University of Washington, and TEALS k12

    2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?

	I am currently looking for a job in the Software Industry
	I would like to work at some of the companies listed in the Ada sponsor list, or in Silicon Valley
	

    3. Taking a year off of work to learn skills for a new career is difficult. How are you preparing for such an endeavor?

	I have previous experience working as a front-end developer with Ruby on Rails at Housecare, and have taken a course
	I would like to take the course to solidify my skills to make sure they are sharp enough to be employable
	I am just out of school, and I can take on a large workload, and have a strong background in theoretical Computer Science


    4. Tell us about the last time you made a mistake. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

	I went to community college instead of university
	I thought I was getting a bargain, but I found it easier to make friends in University
	I would probably go to University first

    5. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.

	I taught myself to speak Japanese fluently despite not being of Japanese ancestry
	The key ingredient to my approach was complete immersion
	I was able to pass the highest level of the JLPT and learned to communicate with native speakers effectively
